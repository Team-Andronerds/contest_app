Competition Theme: Drive to Win!

App Goal: Through the app, customers would be able to participate in a driving challenge, training people to drive safely.
The participants of “Drive to win!” with the highest score would receive discounts on their monthly insurance payments.
Insurance companies would be able to monitor users’ driving quality based on a telematics device that utilizes the
