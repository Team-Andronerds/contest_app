###Android application for the OSU App Center competition.

Competition Theme: Drive to Win!

App Goal: Through the app, customers would be able to participate in a driving challenge, training people to drive safely.
The participants of “Drive to win!” with the highest score would receive discounts on their monthly insurance payments.
Insurance companies would be able to monitor users’ driving quality based on a telematics device that utilizes the
on-board diagnostic (OBD) port of a car. Along with the above feature, the app also consists of predictive time, where the
application predicts the exact time, it would take to reach the destination based on driving habits. The application also
has the features of road assistance, maintenance schedule and shows the driving behavior measuring harsh breaking, harsh
acceleration, harsh turns, speeding for each trip.
